        <p>Self-growth is extremely important to me, and I pride myself on being self-aware and having the willingness to change and grow as an individual. For over a year, I focused on myself and tried to figure out a career path led by my passions. It was a difficult journey of self-growth; I sometimes felt lost and unsure about my purpose.</p>
        <p>I previously studied at Carleton University for Communication and Media Studies. I worked full-time for three years as a Sales and Marketing Project Manager for a home-building company. I enjoyed this for the years I was working there, however, over time, I realized it was not meant for me anymore. I am grateful for the experience as it opened my eyes to the design world and led me to apply to <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at Algonquin College. I am very passionate about travelling, my dogs, photography, design and living every day to the fullest.</p>
        <p>My dogs' names are Pepper and Olive. Pepper is an 8 month old Bernedoodle born on May 27<sup>th</sup>, 2022. Olive is a 10 week old Aussie Bernedoodle born on November 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2022. They are both such fun, energetic puppies and absolutely adore each other. We love going on adventures and exploring the trails around our area.</p>
